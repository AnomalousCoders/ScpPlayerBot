# SCP Player Bot

###### A simple Discord bot showing the Player-Status of your SCP: Secret Laboratory Server!

## Important notice
This project is discontinued and will no longer work! Please contact the official SCP: SL Staff for an API key and try
to implement similar by yourself, if you're dependant on it. I've left the code unchanged in the
`index.js`. As this project is officially declared discontinued, no support will be provided for it anymore.

~~## Installation~~

   ~~1. Make sure you have Node.js (nodejs.org) installed.~~
   ~~2. Run `npm install @anomalouscoders/scpplayerbot` in the directory you want the bot in~~
   ~~3. Set up the `config.json` file in the `node_modules\@anomalouscoders\scpplayerbot` directory(More Details found in~~
   the _Config_ section)
   ~~4. Run `node index` in the directory where the `index.js` is (`node_modules\@anomalouscoders\scpplayerbot` if you don't
   find it)~~
